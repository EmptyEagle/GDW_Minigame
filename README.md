TITLE:

Defend the Cliffline

Aim your cannon and fire at the targets. If the targets get too close they will start firing at you, so stay attentive and do not let them reach you.
Hit certain targets to gain power-ups, which will give you an edge in your defense.

CONTROLS:

[KEYBOARD]

WASD/Arrow Keys - Rotate cannon

Space - Fire cannon

Escape - Quit game

[CONTROLLER]

Left Stick - Rotate cannon

Bottom Face-Button - Fire cannon

DEV LOG:

- Rotating cannon based on player directional input; Limiting this movement within a range
- Ability to fire cannonballs; Forced cooldown between shots
- Targets that spawn and move toward the player; Destroying them upon collision with a cannonball
- UI to keep track of and visualize player health and score
- Increasing target speed and spawn rate as the game progresses
- Sound design to highlight important facets of gameplay (including sounds for firing, reloading, hitting targets, and taking damage)
- Visual indicator to better convey player cannonball status (whether the cannon is on cooldown) and damage vignette upon taking damage
- Special targets that travel across the player's view and grant power-ups upon being hit (including faster cannon turning [blue], double cannonball firing [red], and faster reloading [yellow])
- Visual indicators to show the player's active power-ups
- Adding sprites for each power-up to more clearly convey their qualities
